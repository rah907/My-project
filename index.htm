        Kabul House will definitely be on the list of the best Afghan restaurants in Tehran. This beautiful and cozy restaurant is run by an Afghan family who were forced to migrate to Iran for more than three decades. In this restaurant, family members themselves cook and serve the customers from start to finish.
        Using the freshest and highest quality ingredients for cooking is the secret to the popularity of this restaurant. On the other hand, the beautiful atmosphere of the restaurant can take you directly to the heart of Kabul. Beautiful photos of Afghan people on the restaurant wall, playing pleasant Afghan songs and shelves of traditional clothes will amaze you.
